Amazon Shareholders Should Reject CEO Pay Package, Advisers Say

Confidence rating:     
Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, according to the company's 2022 proxy statement.

He also owns space exploration company Blue Origin, which is included at Bloomberg's calculation of investment cost. 

Determining a valuation for Blue Origin is difficult because of its unique strategy and the fact that Bezos is the sole shareholder with no apparent intent to sell, according to Chad Anderson, CEO of venture fund Space Angels. A Blue Origin director said at a 2014 space conference in Washington that the billionaire had invested "at least $500 million," which is accounted for in equal amounts over 13 years beginning in 2001, the year Blue Origin was incorporated. 

Bezos said in April 2017 that he funds the enterprise through the sale of "about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock." That amount is deducted from the after-tax proceeds of his known share sales from 2014 and categorized as funding for Blue Origin. That amount was assumed to be $2 billion in 2021 as the company performed its first human-crewed flights and Bezos's share sales accelerated. Since 2002, he's sold about $29 billion worth of Amazon shares, based on an analysis of Bloomberg data.

Bezos paid $250 million for the Washington Post in August 2013, which is included at cost.

He committed $2 billion to social issues in 2018 and made a pledge in February 2020 to donate $10 billion to help counter the effects of climate change. These amounts will be deducted from his net worth when gifts are made.

The value of his cash investments includes these transactions, taxes and market performance. Bezos held 16% of Amazon before a 4% stake was transferred to MacKenzie Scott in 2019 following the pair's divorce. About $650 million was deducted from the cash balance at this time to reflect Bloomberg's estimate of the cost of his divorce outside of Amazon shares.

Drew Herdener, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment on Bezos's net worth.

Biography
Birthdate: 1/12/1964
Family: Divorced, 4 children
Education: Princeton University, Princeton University
Jeff Bezos is a former Wall Street computer engineer who created Amazon in 1994 to sell books online. After an initial public offering in 1997, Amazon stock shot up almost 40-fold, sending Bezos's personal fortune above $12 billion. By the time the technology bubble had finished deflating in 2001, his shares were valued at less than $2 billion.

The Princeton graduate built his reputation on long-term thinking and focusing on customer service. Today, Amazon sells millions of different products, many of which are purveyed by third-party vendors that rely on Amazon's data management services to help fulfill their orders.

The company introduced the Kindle electronic book reader in 2007. It's now Amazon's biggest-selling item. Four years later, Amazon released the Kindle Fire, putting the company in competition with Apple in the tablet computer business.

Bezos owns the Washington Post and also oversees Blue Origin, a space exploration company that seeks to lower the cost and increase the safety of spaceflight. He pledged $2 billion of his fortune toward preschool programs and support for homeless families in September 2018, and $10 billion to fighting climate change in February 2020.

Bezos and his wife MacKenzie divorced in 2019. MacKenzie received a 4% stake in Amazon as part of their separation.

He announced in February 2021 that he would retire as chief executive of Amazon, with plans to devote more time to his philanthropy and other companies. In July 2021 he joined Blue Origin's first crewed mission.

Net Worth Summary
 Cash  Private asset  Public asset  Misc. liabilities
Confidence rating:     
The majority of Arnault's fortune is derived from a 97.5% stake in Christian Dior, the luxury fashion house. He holds the shares through entities associated with Groupe Familial Arnault, according to Dior's 2020 annual report. Bernard Arnault is credited with all shares held by the family holding company in Dior, as well its other holdings, to reflect his status as founder and patriarch.

Christian Dior controls 41.2% of LVMH, the world's largest luxury-goods maker, according to Dior's 2020 annual report. These shares aren't included in the analysis because the value is already captured. The family holds an additional 6.2% of LVMH, according to its 2020 registration document, and these shares are included in the net wealth calculation.

Liabilities in the analysis include debts held by Arnault's family holding company, associated with the purchase and restructuring on public shareholdings. The value of his cash holdings is based on an analysis of dividends, market performance, insider transactions, taxes and charitable contributions.

Molly Morse, a spokeswoman for Arnault at Kekst & Co., said the billionaire declined to comment on his net worth calculation.

Biography
Birthdate: 3/5/1949
Family: Married, 5 children
Education: Ecole Polytechnique
Bernard Arnault was born in the northern French town of Roubaix in 1949. After graduating with an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, he joined his family's company and persuaded his father to exit its construction business and focus on real estate.

Arnault entered the luxury goods market in 1984, when he took over the bankrupt textile group that owned Christian Dior. He sold all of the company's other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH. Other acquisitions include Fendi, TAG Heuer and Bulgari. He sought and failed to buy auction house Sotheby's and retailer Gucci, which he lost to rival billionaire Francois Pinault in 2010.

LVMH agreed to relinquish its 23 percent stake in Hermes to its shareholders in September 2014, ending a four-year battle to gain control of the luxury label. He remained its biggest individual shareholder until July 2017, when he sold most of his shares as part of a $13.2 billion deal to consolidate his control of Christian Dior.

The billionaire lives on Paris's Left Bank with his second wife, concert pianist Helene Mercier. His art collection of modern and contemporary paintings includes pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.

Arnault sparked a debate over taxation in France in 2012 when Belgium's government disclosed that he was seeking to become a Belgian citizen. Arnault said he intended to still pay taxes in France. His request was aimed at safeguarding a foundation he'd established in Belgium to "protect the financial interests and wealth" of his heirs. In April 2013, he withdrew his application as "a gesture of my attachment to France and my faith in its future."
